html-start
==========

A basic HTML5 scaffolding to be used as a starting point when creating websites etc.

Has a bunch of dummy files lying around so that git will save the directory structure.

Includes reset.css to have a consistent starting point, this file can be minified and joined with style.css to make one CSS file to rule them all.
